                <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> (1815-1852) was a visionary mathematician and writer, often regarded as
                the world's first
                computer programmer. Born Augusta Ada Byron, she made significant contributions to the field of
                computing during the early 19th century.

                        the translation, including an algorithm that can be processed by the Analytical Engine. These
